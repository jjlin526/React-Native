### State

* Props are read-only and should not be modified
* State allows React components to change their output over time in response to user actions, network responses, etc.

### State vs Props in React

* In a React component, the props are the variables that we pass from a parent component to a child component
* The state are also variables; they are not passed as parameters, but rather the component initializes and manages them internally'

### Are there differences in how React and React Native handle state?

* There is no difference in handling state between React and React Native
* You can use the state of your components both in classes and in functional components using hooks
