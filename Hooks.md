### Hooks

Hooks are specially-implemented functions that let us add functionality to React components beyond just creating and returning React elements.

Common built-in hooks: 
* **useState** - Persist state within a component function
* **useReducer** - Similar to useState, but for state that involves multiple sub-values
* **useEffect** - Perform side effects within our component functions
* **useRef** - Wrap a mutable value

Recommended to use eslint and react-hooks plugin to catch mistakes before running code.
